2025-01-07,"It's my understanding that Astra positions FLAURA2 only for subpopulations like pts with brain mets or other subgroups of interest with a larger clinical benefit than in ITT, given the tox addon of chemo. For the other settings, they're currently relying on osi mono. That's why I am not sure the benchmark is MARIPOSA vs FLAURA2. I don't see them escalating FLAURA2 again in 1L now, just b/c MARIPOSA hit on OS. Instead, they have the osi+Dato-DXd combo for 1L EGFRm now in pivotal trial. I guess the bet is now on TL-14 to replace FLAURA.
